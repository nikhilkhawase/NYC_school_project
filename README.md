## About project:
Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process. 

### Problem statement:
#### 1) Which are the best maths school?
#### 2) Which are the top 10 schools in NYC?
#### 3) Which NYC borough has the highest standard deviation for total_SAT?

Answering these questions is  is important to a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.
